<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Fairoze Fatema Alam, a passionate and ambitious Computer Science and Engineering student at United International University, currently in my second year. I’ve consistently excelled academically, earning a GPA of 5.00 in both SSC and HSC from Shaheed Bir Uttam Lt. Anwar Girls' College.

<p>My interests lie in diverse areas of technology, including Web Development, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Cybersecurity, Cloud Computing, and Digital Marketing. I am also deeply curious about the Internet of Things (IoT), Networking, and Data Science. I’ve developed a solid foundation in C and Java, and I’m actively building my technical skillset step by step to align with my career goals.</p>

<p>Beyond academics, I'm involved in several extracurricular activities. I serve as an Associate of PR at the UIU App Forum, where I also engage in anchoring. I’ve previously worked as a Campus Ambassador for Dhaka College Science Club and was a BNCC Pilot during college life. My achievements include multiple awards in sports and writing, including a Table Tennis Runner-up title and a top-four finish in an essay competition.</p>

<p>Whether it's working on a team project, organizing events, or diving into new technologies, I strive to grow, contribute, and make a meaningful impact in everything I do. I'm always excited to learn, collaborate, and push boundaries in the world of tech.</p>
